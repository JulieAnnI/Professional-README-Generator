  ## Description
  
  You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. The generator uses Inquirer package to prompt the user to fill in every section of the README and then automatically generates a README.md file in your project folder with all the information you entered neatly formated into a best practices README.

  To use this generator, open terminal and clone this repo. Navigate into the app folder. If you have not already, download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You also must download [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Once these are installed, type the command "node index.js" into the terminal. The generator willactive and prompt you with several questions. Once you are finished, the README.md will appear in your folder. 
  
  ## Usage
  
  This Professional README Generator can be used by anyone who needs to create a README for a project. It is an easy and simple way to create a professional-grade README with very little effort and time required from the user. I can see this project becoming even more detailed in the future to make READMEs that go above and beyond the standard and really fully immerse any viewer on what your project can do.
